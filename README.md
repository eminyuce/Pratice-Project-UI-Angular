# AcquUserEntity Management UI

This project provides a user interface (UI) for managing `AcquUserEntity` records. The interface supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting records with advanced filtering, bulk actions, auditing capabilities, and more. It is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and visually clear.

## Features

### 1. Data Entry Form
- **Create/Update AcquUserEntity records**
- **Fields**: 
  - `userEntityId` (Hidden - auto-generated by backend)
  - `userName` (Text input)
  - `userEmail` (Text input, must be a valid email format)
  - `phoneModel` (Text input, requires uppercase text)
  - `userDescription` (HTML editor for rich text)
  - `status` (Hidden - auto-handled by backend)
  - `createdDate` (Hidden - auto-handled by backend)
  - `updatedDate` (Hidden - auto-handled by backend)
- **Validation**:
  - `userEmail`: Must be a valid email format.
  - `phoneModel`: Must be in uppercase text.
  - All fields except `userDescription` are required.
- **Behavior**:
  - The form is initially collapsed with an "Add New" button to expand.
  - Displays success or error messages upon submission.

### 2. Data Grid
- **Display and manage AcquUserEntity records** in a tabular format with:
  - Columns: 
    - Checkbox (for bulk actions)
    - `Details` button
    - `userEntityId`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `phoneModel`, `userDescription`, `status`, `createdDate`, `updatedDate`
  - **Filtering**:
    - Field-based and date range filtering
    - Sort data by clicking column headers
    - Pagination for large datasets
  - **Bulk Actions**:
    - Bulk update `status` to 'DELETED', 'FROZEN', 'LIVE', 'TEST'
    - Apply actions via checkboxes and status dropdown
    - Status row coloring (red for 'DELETED', blue for 'FROZEN', green for 'LIVE')
  - **Record Actions**:
    - View record details in a popup.
    - Edit records directly in the table using an editable dropdown for `phoneModel`.
    - Global search across all fields.
    - Export data to Excel.
    - Reload table and refresh data grid after actions.

### 3. Backend Interaction
- All data fetching, saving, updating, deleting, and filtering interactions are handled via backend Java controller services.
- **Backend Responsibilities**:
  - Return success or failure status with appropriate messages.
  - Provide dropdown values for `phoneModel`.
  - Enable Excel export generation.
  - Maintain audit trail for all changes to records.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly messages for validation, server, or network issues.
- **Audit Trail**: Keep logs of changes to `AcquUserEntity` records, including who made the changes and when.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict functionalities based on user roles (e.g., only admins can delete records).
- **Performance**: Ensure the UI is responsive with efficient data fetching, pagination, and backend optimization.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to accessibility guidelines to ensure usability for all users.
- **Security**: Secure data transmission and prevent potential security issues such as XSS and SQL injection.
- **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive, clean, and user-friendly interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Database**: (To be determined based on project context)
- **UI Library**: Material UI or similar
- **Excel Export**: Apache POI or similar

## UI Mockups

UI mockups and wireframes will be created separately to visualize the user flow and interface design.
